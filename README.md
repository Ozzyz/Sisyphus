# Sisyphus
An attempt to create a simple chess engine in c++.

## Why?
I am a fan of chess and programming, and this project is a perfect mix between the two. 
In addition, i want to try to make an improved version of this engine using artificial intelligence, heavily inspired by Matthew Lai's master thesis - 
'Giraffe: Using Deep Reinforcement Learning to Play Chess' (https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01549).

## TODO:
- Capture lists
- State evaluation function
- Minmiax implementation
- UCI-conformity (http://wbec-ridderkerk.nl/html/UCIProtocol.html)
